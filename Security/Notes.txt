Computer Security - Protection of Assets

	Data

Security Triad - ON EXAM
	Confidentiality - assets only views by authorized.
	Integrity - No unathorized modification of assets.
	Availability - Authorized parties can view/modify assets at all authorized times.

Types of attacks:
	Interruption - Availability, DDoS
	Interception - Confidentiality, Sniffing/Snooping
	Modification - Integrity, Authentication, NonRepudiation, Man-In-the-Middle
	Fabrications - Integrity, Authentication, NonRepudiation, Replay, Spoofing

MOM: 
	Method
	Opportunity
	Motive

Control
	Prevent - block attack/close vulnerability
	Deter - made attack harder
	Deflect - make another target more appealing/attractive
	Mitigate - make impact/harm less severe 
	Detect - identify if attack happened/happening
	Recover - return to a known/secure state


Exam Answers:

	Stream			Block

pro	Speed			high diffusion
	low error prop		not susceptible to insertion/modification
				computationally cheap

con	low diffusion		slow
	susceptible to 		error prop
	 insertion attack	padding
	computationally
	 expensive

Diffusion: Spreading out the characters in the ciphertext, so things don't line up anymore
Error Propogation: mistakes in one place moving into other areas

Key management: Number of keys and ~something~


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1976 Diffie Hellman - The first public key cryptosystem, based on the discrete log problem. Key agreement protocol.
	n = g^k mod p
	Not used because there is no authentication.

1978 RSA - Rivest Shamir Adelman, based on factoring large numbers


Buffer overflow
Incomplete mediation
Time to check to time of use
Undocumented access point - backdoor
Off by one error
int overflow
Unterminated null string
Unsafe libraries
Race conditions
